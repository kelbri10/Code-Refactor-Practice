The Code Refactor: This folder is comprised of provided html and respective assets (css and images) provided. The object of the assignment was to refactor the code, i.e. clean up the html and css to meet the needs demonstrated in the user story. Many html elements were redundant so I consolidated them under one class while maintaining the <div> tags they were written under. This allowed for the css attributes to be consolidated under the listed class in the css, shortening the amount of classes in the css file. By doing this, the code is made more accessible to the user, who can easily adjust the attributes to suit their needs as necessary, without difficulty.
